Bugs:
    ✔ ui doesn't show @critical @done(25-07-22 21:52)
    The Z of the UI is set to -500, is that correct?
    Should -500 be closer than 0?

Must Have:
    ✔ Grid system @done(25-02-07 10:52)
    ✔ WASD movement @done(25-07-23 13:00)
    ☐ Placing tiles
    ☐ better world generation
        Should be infinite. I think it should be chunk based or something.
        Not sure how that would work with a hex grid. Maybe the world should be a node graph internally?
        Each node has 6 neighbors instead of 4.
        Resource placement.


Should Have:
    ☐ some sort of fog of war effect
        1) not have to create the entire world at the start
        2) make it more interesting to explore

Could Have:
